# iCEDemo

It is likely not the final name of the project...

The goal of the project is to provide a HDMI output capable baseboard for the
iCEBreaker-Bitsy FPGA development board. The motivation is mainly the ability
to create fun and interesting Demoscene type realtime generated audiovisual art
creations. At the same time we also want some kind of control input to double
as a retro inspired game console.
